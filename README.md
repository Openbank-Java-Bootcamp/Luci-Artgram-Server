# ARTGRAM 

## Description
In this REST API project I built a social network. The system has 5 Models:
- User
- Role
- Painting
- Comment
- Like

Artgram is a social network where artists can exhibit their works.
You can upload, edit and delete your paintings. Also, you can see another artists paintings and like and comment their works.

## Set Up
1. Clone or download the project from the repository.
2. Open the directory as a project on a IDE as IntelliJ.
3. Create a MySQL database: artgram.
4. Run the *ArtgramServerApllicationProject.java* file on the path:

```
src/main/java/com/ironhack/Artgramserver/ArtgramServerApplication.java
```
5. Follow the instructions in the other Repository: Luci-Artgram-Client.
